# project3-equipment

## Ideas for analysis

- Does the authorization/supply of new weapons systems/operational parameters impact equipment losses?
    - Need to extract historic data
    - Not possible due to format of data provided by Oryx, would need to be collecting with every update
    - Would need to correlate with this sheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bngHbR0YPS7XH1oSA1VxoL4R34z60SJcR3NxguZM9GI/edit?gid=0#gid=0
    - We could also pull dailies from web archive: https://web.archive.org/web/20240104001559/https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html
- How do equivalent systems perform when used by UKR/RUS?
